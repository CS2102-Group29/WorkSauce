# WorkSauce

## Welcome to WorkSauce!

WorkSauce is a platform that connects taskees and taskers. Upon signing up for a new account, 
a normal user can either submit tasks or pick tasks. Tasks are general chores such as:
* washing a car on Kent Valeâ€™s car park on Sunday starting at 4:00 pm
* delivering a parcel on Tuesday between 17:00 and 19:00. 

A user who wants to pick a task can bid the **hourly rate (in USD)** that he is willing to 
accept for that particular task. The user who submits that task will have to choose the 
successful bidder before the stipulated expiry date (specified during task submission).

There are two types of account, namely the normal user account and the administrator account. 
Besides all the functionalities available to the normal users, administrators can create, 
modify and delete all entries. To create an administrator account, please refer to 
[Creating an Administrator Account](#Creating-an-Administrator-Account) section.

## Getting Started Guide

The following are the breakdown of the pages in WorkSauce web application to help you navigate

The home page shows all the tasks submitted by all the users. You can filter the tasks by using
the search bar on the top left hand corner of the screen.

Click on the name of the taskee to see his/her profile.

Click on the task title (the one following `Need help with`) to see the task details and bid
for the task.

Note that you will be able to see all the tasks you have submitted, but you will not be able 
to bid for those tasks.

<summary><b>Tasks Created</b></summary>
<br>
<p align="center">
  <img width="400" src="https://github.com/CS2102-Group29/WorkSauce/blob/master/screenshots/Tasks_Created.png">
</p>

You will be able to see all the tasks you have submitted here. You can click on the `Edit` and 
`Delete` buttons to edit and delete the task respectively. Note that you will not be able to
edit or delete tasks that have passed.

You will also be able to see all the bidders who are interested in the tasks. You can choose a
successful bidder by using the toggle button beside the name of the bidder, and click accept.

</p>

Bidding Manager collates all your bids in one place, whether they are successful, unsuccessful,
or still ongoing. 

For the ongoing bids, you can easily modify your bids from this page. You can
also see the lowest bid for the task so far. Note that the tasker is one who eventually
decides the successful bidder (which may or may not be based on the bids placed).

You can click on the task title or taskee name to see their details.

## Creating an Administrator Account

To create an administrator account:
1. Navigate to the sign up page and fill in the form as per normal user sign up. 
2. Fill in the optional admin passcode field. The admin passcode is set to 'I am an admin'. 

<p align="center">

</p>

An administartor can subsequently sign in to his/her account like a normal user while 
retaining all the administrators' privileges. Below is the screenshot on the sign up page.

## Dummy Accounts

We have created 20 normal user accounts and 2 administrator accounts for you to try out.
To sign in as a normal user, key in `testX@example.com` and `testY` for the email and
password fields respectively.  To sign in as an administrator, key in `adminZ@example.com` and
`adminW` for the email and password fields respectively.

* X is a number from 1 to 20 inclusive
* Y is a number from 01 to 20 inclusive (at least 2 character long)
* Z is a number from 1 to 2 inclusive
* W is a number from 01 to 02 inclusive (at least 2 character long)

For example:

* email : `admin1@example.com` ; password : `admin01`
* email : `test3@example.com` ; password : `test03`
* email : `test15@example.com` ; password : `test15`
