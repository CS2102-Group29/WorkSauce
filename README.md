# WorkSauce

## Welcome to WorkSauce!

WorkSauce is a platform that connects taskees and taskers. Upon signing up for a new account, 
a normal user can either submit tasks or pick tasks. Tasks are general chores such as:
* washing a car on Kent Valeâ€™s car park on Sunday starting at 4:00 pm
* delivering a parcel on Tuesday between 17:00 and 19:00. 

A user who wants to pick a task can bid the **hourly rate (in USD)** that he is willing to 
accept for that particular task. The user who submits that task will have to choose the 
successful bidder before the stipulated expiry date (specified during task submission).

There are two types of account, namely the normal user account and the administrator account. 
Besides all the functionalities available to the normal users, administrators can create, 
modify and delete all entries. To create an administrator account, please refer to 
[Creating an Administrator Account](#Creating-an-Administrator-Account)

## Creating an Administrator Account

To create an administrator account, navigate to the sign up page and fill in the form as per 
normal user sign up. Fill in the optional admin passcode field. The admin passcode is set to 
'I am an admin'. An administartor can subsequently sign in to his/her account like a normal 
user while retaining all the administrators' privileges. Below is the screenshot on the sign
up page.
